WHERE e2.EMPNO IS NULL;
```

**60. List of emps of emp1 who are not found in emp2.**

SELECT ENAME, SAL, COMM
FROM EMPY
WHERE (SAL + IFNULL(COMM, 0)) >= ALL (SELECT (SAL + IFNULL(COMM,0)) FROM EMPY);


-- Method 2: Using ORDER BY and LIMIT 1
SELECT ENAME, SAL, COMM FROM EMPY
ORDER BY (SAL + IFNULL(COMM, 0)) DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**100. List the emp whose sal < his manager but more than any other manager.**

```sql
-- Method 1: Using Nested Subqueries
SELECT e1.*
FROM EMPY e1
WHERE e1.SAL < (SELECT SAL FROM EMPY WHERE EMPNO = e1.MGR)
AND e1.SAL > ALL (SELECT SAL FROM EMPY WHERE JOB = 'MANAGER');

-- Method 2: Using Join and All clause
SELECT e1.*
FROM EMPY e1
JOIN EMPY e2 ON e1.MGR = e2.EMPNO
WHERE e1.SAL < e2.SAL
AND e1.SAL > ALL (SELECT SAL FROM EMPY WHERE JOB = 'MANAGER');
```
