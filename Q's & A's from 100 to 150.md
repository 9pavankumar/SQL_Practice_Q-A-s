```

**121. Count the No.of emps who are working as ‘Managers’(using set option).**
*(The "set option" wording here is a bit ambiguous, and might refer to a specific DB feature or a variable setting.
I will interpret this as meaning to provide the count using a subquery or a CTE)*
```sql
-- Method 1: Using subquery and count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM EMPY WHERE JOB='MANAGER') as subquery;

-- Method 2: Simple count with where clause
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPY WHERE JOB='MANAGER';
```

FROM (SELECT ENAME, SAL FROM EMPY) AS subquery;
```

**127. Produce the output of EMP table ‘EMP_AND_JOB’ for Ename and Job.**
*(This looks like a formatting question. I'll answer as if outputting a combined field)*

```sql
-- Method 1: Using CONCAT
SELECT CONCAT(ENAME, ' (', JOB, ')') AS EMP_AND_JOB
FROM EMPY;

-- Method 2: Using string concatenation operators (depends on database)
SELECT ENAME || ' (' || JOB || ')' as EMP_AND_JOB FROM EMPY;
```

**128. Produce the following output from EMP. EMPLOYEE SMITH (clerk) ALLEN (Salesman)**
*(Similar to the formatting question above, but adds the literal "EMPLOYEE")*

```sql
-- Method 1: Using CONCAT
SELECT CONCAT('EMPLOYEE ', ENAME, ' (', JOB, ')')
FROM EMPY;

-- Method 2: using string concatenation (db dependent)
SELECT 'EMPLOYEE ' || ENAME || ' (' || JOB || ')' as output
FROM EMPY;
```

**130) List the emps with Hire date in format June 4, 1988.**

```sql
-- Method 1: using DATE_FORMAT
SELECT ENAME, DATE_FORMAT(HIREDATE, '%M %e, %Y') as formatted_hire_date
FROM EMPY;

-- Method 2: Database-specific date formatting (like strftime in SQLite)
SELECT ENAME, strftime('%B %d, %Y', HIREDATE) AS formatted_hire_date
FROM EMPY;
```

**131)Print a list of emp’s Listing ‘just salary’ if Salary is more than 1500, on target if Salary is -- 1500 and ‘Below -- 1500’ if Salary is less than-- 1500.**

```sql
-- Method 1: Using CASE statement
SELECT ENAME,
       CASE
         WHEN SAL > 1500 THEN 'just salary'
         WHEN SAL = 1500 THEN 'on target'
         ELSE 'Below 1500'
       END AS salary_status
FROM EMPY;

-- Method 2: Using IF statement (alternative)
SELECT ENAME,
       IF(SAL > 1500, 'just salary', IF(SAL = 1500, 'on target', 'Below 1500')) AS salary_status
FROM EMPY;
```
**132)Write a query which returns the day of the week for any date entered in format ‘DD-MM-YY’.**
*(This will require date formatting as well as functions to return the day of the week - database-specific)*
```sql
-- Method 1: Using DATE_FORMAT (MySQL)
SELECT DATE_FORMAT('2024-01-26', '%W');

-- Method 2: Using strftime (SQLite)
SELECT strftime('%w', '2024-01-26'); -- returns 0-6 for day of week

-- Method 3: Using DAYNAME (SQL Server)
SELECT DATENAME(weekday,'2024-01-26');
```
**Note**: The specific function used depends on your SQL database system. You might use `DAYNAME`, `strftime`, or other similar functions.

**133)Write a query to calculate the length of service of any employee with the company, use DEFINE to avoid repetitive typing of functions.**
*(Here I will show how to do a calculation and include that calculation in the output as a variable)*

```sql
-- Method 1: using calculation in select
SELECT ENAME, (YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(HIREDATE)) as length_of_service
FROM EMPY;

-- Method 2: using a common table expression
WITH EmployeeService AS (
    SELECT ENAME, (YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(HIREDATE)) AS service_years
    FROM EMPY
)
SELECT ENAME, service_years
FROM EmployeeService;
```
**Note**: `DEFINE` is not standard SQL, but some DBs may have specific ways to declare variables. I have used a CTE as a general solution.

**134)Give a string of format ‘NN/NN’, verify that the first and last two characters are numbers and that the middle character is’/’. 
Print the expression ‘YES’ if valid, ‘NO’ if not valid. Use the following values to test your solution. ‘-- 12/34’,’0-- 1/-- 1a’, ‘99/98’.**
```sql
-- Method 1: Using CASE and LIKE
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN '12/34' LIKE '[0-9][0-9]/[0-9][0-9]' THEN 'YES'
        ELSE 'NO'
    END as result1,
	CASE
        WHEN '01/1a' LIKE '[0-9][0-9]/[0-9][0-9]' THEN 'YES'
        ELSE 'NO'
    END as result2,
	CASE
        WHEN '99/98' LIKE '[0-9][0-9]/[0-9][0-9]' THEN 'YES'
        ELSE 'NO'
    END as result3;

-- Method 2: Using regex functions (db dependent)
-- (MySQL example)
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN '12/34' REGEXP '^[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}$' THEN 'YES'
        ELSE 'NO'
    END as result1,
    CASE
        WHEN '01/1a' REGEXP '^[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}$' THEN 'YES'
        ELSE 'NO'
    END as result2,
	CASE
        WHEN '99/98' REGEXP '^[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}$' THEN 'YES'
        ELSE 'NO'
    END as result3;

```
**Note**: Regex functionality depends on your database system. LIKE statements use standard wildcards.

**135)Emps hired on or before 15th of any month are paid on the last Friday of that month those hired after 15th are paid on the first
Friday of the following month. Print a list of emps their hire date and the first pay date. Sort on hire date.**
*(This requires date calculations and specific DB functions)*
```sql
-- Method 1: (Database-specific logic - MySQL)
SELECT ENAME, HIREDATE,
       CASE
           WHEN DAY(HIREDATE) <= 15
           THEN LAST_DAY(HIREDATE) - INTERVAL (DAYOFWEEK(LAST_DAY(HIREDATE)) - 6) DAY
           ELSE  LAST_DAY(HIREDATE + INTERVAL 1 MONTH)  - INTERVAL (DAYOFWEEK(LAST_DAY(HIREDATE + INTERVAL 1 MONTH)) - 6) DAY
        END AS pay_date
FROM EMPY
ORDER BY HIREDATE;

-- Method 2: Using Common Table expression
WITH PayDates AS (
SELECT ENAME, HIREDATE, CASE
WHEN DAY(HIREDATE) <= 15
THEN LAST_DAY(HIREDATE) - INTERVAL (DAYOFWEEK(LAST_DAY(HIREDATE)) - 6) DAY
ELSE LAST_DAY(HIREDATE + INTERVAL 1 MONTH) - INTERVAL (DAYOFWEEK(LAST_DAY(HIREDATE + INTERVAL 1 MONTH)) - 6) DAY
END AS pay_date
FROM EMPY)
SELECT ENAME, HIREDATE, pay_date
FROM PayDates
ORDER BY HIREDATE;

```
**Note**: `LAST_DAY` ,`DAYOFWEEK`,`INTERVAL`  functions used above are MySQL Specific, you may need different function for your database.

**136)Count the no. of characters without considering spaces for each name.**

```sql
-- Method 1: Using REPLACE and LENGTH
SELECT ENAME, LENGTH(REPLACE(ENAME, ' ', '')) AS char_count
FROM EMPY;

-- Method 2: using string function and length
SELECT ENAME, LENGTH(TRIM(ENAME)) as char_count
FROM EMPY;

```
**137)Find out the emps who are getting decimal value in their Sal without using like operator.**

```sql
-- Method 1: using string function
SELECT *
FROM EMPY
WHERE CAST(SAL as CHAR) LIKE '%.%'

-- Method 2: Using data type and check (Database dependent and not fully guaranteed, might need implicit type casting or regex)
SELECT * FROM EMPY WHERE SAL<>FLOOR(SAL);

```

**Note**:  Some SQL databases may not have implicit typecasting and may need functions like `REGEXP` or casting to `VARCHAR` and checking 
`LIKE '% .%'` which uses a `LIKE` operator.

**138)List those emps whose Salary contains first four digit of their Deptno**

```sql
-- Method 1: Using LIKE and SUBSTR with CAST
SELECT *
FROM EMPY
WHERE CAST(SAL AS CHAR) LIKE CONCAT(SUBSTR(CAST(DEPTNO as CHAR),1,4),'%');

JOIN EMPY e2 ON e1.MGR = e2.EMPNO
WHERE e2.ENAME = 'BLAKE';
```
**141)List the emps who are working as Managers using co-related sub- query.**

```sql
-- Method 1: Correlated subquery (Using EXISTS)
SELECT *
FROM EMPY e1
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM EMPY e2 WHERE e2.EMPNO = e1.EMPNO AND e2.JOB = 'MANAGER');

-- Method 2:  Using a simple subquery (less efficient)
SELECT * FROM EMPY WHERE EMPNO IN(SELECT EMPNO FROM EMPY WHERE JOB='MANAGER');
```
**142)List the emps whose Mgr name is ‘Jones’ and also with his Manager name.**

```sql

```

**145)Find Average salary and Average total remuneration for each Jobtype. Remember Salesman earn commission.**

FROM EMPY) AS subquery
GROUP BY JOB;
```

**146)Check whether all the emps numbers are indeed unique.**

```sql
-- Method 1: Using COUNT with DISTINCT and without
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_emps, COUNT(DISTINCT EMPNO) as unique_empnos
FROM EMPY;

-- Method 2: using having clause
SELECT 'Unique' FROM EMPY
GROUP BY EMPNO
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;

-- to check if not unique:
SELECT EMPNO from EMPY GROUP BY EMPNO HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
**Note**: If both counts are the same, the employee numbers are unique.

**147)List the emps who are drawing less than -- 1000 Sort the output by Salary.**

```sql
